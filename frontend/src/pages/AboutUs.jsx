      <p>
        BBK Chat is a simple, fun, and anonymous way to talk to strangers around the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Created BBK</h2>
      <p>
        In today's fast-paced world, sometimes you just need someone to talk to—without filters, without pressure, and without sharing your identity.
        BBK Chat was built with that exact thought in mind: a space where people can connect, express, and share freely.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To create a safe and anonymous environment where anyone can enjoy spontaneous conversations with strangers.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes BBK Special?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Instant chatting—no sign-ups, no logins</li>
        <li>Anonymous by design</li>
        <li>Simple, lightweight, and user-friendly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>
